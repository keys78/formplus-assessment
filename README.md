## The Challenge
To be build react to handle large amount of data.

## Expected Bejaviour
- Project to be able to parse data from the provide api link to UI.
- Only one category on the templates can be active at a time.
- Template headers should bear their respective namme, when on filter on onsearch.
- “All templates” is active by default. Changing the category section resets all other filters and the Search bar value.
- Template category can either be "All", "Education", "E-commerce" or "Health".
- Users should also be able to search through each template category individually using only their template names.
- Users should be able to filter each template category based on - either not both (reset the other filter when one is active).
- The Alphabetical Order filter can either be "Default", "Ascending" or "Descending" order
- The Date created filter can either be "Default", "Ascending" or "Descending" order
- General design principle apllication.
